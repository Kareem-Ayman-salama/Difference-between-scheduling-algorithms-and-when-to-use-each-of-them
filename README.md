Scheduling algorithms are used in operating systems to manage the execution of processes and threads on a computer's CPU. Each scheduling algorithm has its own approach to determining which process should run next. The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on factors like the nature of the tasks, system requirements, and performance goals. Here are some commonly used scheduling algorithms and when to use each of them:

1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):**
   - Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
   - Suitable for batch processing or when all processes have similar execution times.
   - Can result in poor response time and inefficient CPU utilization for short processes.

2. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF):**
   - The process with the shortest burst time is selected to run next.
   - Ideal for reducing average waiting time, but requires knowledge of burst times in advance (may not be practical).

3. **Round Robin (RR):**
   - Each process is allocated a fixed time slice (quantum) before being moved to the back of the queue.
   - Suitable for interactive systems and timesharing, providing fair execution to all processes.
   - Overhead from context switching can impact performance.

4. **Priority Scheduling:**
   - Processes are assigned priorities, and the one with the highest priority runs next.
   - Used when different processes have different levels of importance.
   - May suffer from priority inversion or starvation if not implemented carefully.

5. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:**
   - Processes are divided into different queues based on priority, each with its own scheduling algorithm.
   - Suitable for systems with varying levels of priority or service requirements.

6. **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling:**
   - Similar to multilevel queue, but processes can move between queues based on their behavior.
   - Suitable for handling a mix of short and long processes.

7. **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN):**
   - Calculates a response ratio for each process and selects the one with the highest ratio.
   - Balances between short processes and those that have been waiting for a longer time.

8. **Lottery Scheduling:**
   - Processes are assigned "lottery tickets," and a lottery determines the next process to run.
   - Useful when providing proportional CPU time to different users or processes.

9. **Earliest Deadline First (EDF):**
   - Processes are scheduled based on their deadlines, where the process with the earliest deadline runs next.
   - Common in real-time systems where meeting deadlines is crucial.

10. **Fair Share Scheduling:**
    - Ensures that each user or group gets a fair share of CPU time.
    - Useful in shared systems to prevent resource monopolization.

The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the nature of the workload, system requirements, and performance goals. Real-time systems may prioritize deadlines, while interactive systems may prioritize responsiveness. The goal is to strike a balance between fairness, efficiency, and meeting performance targets.
